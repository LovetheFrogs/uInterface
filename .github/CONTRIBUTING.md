In order for a PR to be accepted, you have to consider the following:

* Typo fixes will **NOT** be accepted. If you want to submit the existance of a typo, create a new issue and add the doucmentation tag to it.
* The PR has to be significant. That means no unnecesary features or bloat ones

Other considerations may be taken when tackling each PR individually.

If you want your PR to be given more attention, create a new issue and link it to the pull request
